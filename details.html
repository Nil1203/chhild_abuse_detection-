        <br />Basic Introduction-<br />
        Human face recognition have been an active research area for the last
        few decades. Especially, during the last five years, it has gained
        significant research attention from multiple domains like computer
        vision, machine learning and artificial intelligence due to its
        remarkable progress and broad social applications. The primary goal of
        any face recognition system is to recognize the human identity from the
        static images, video data, data-streams and the knowledge of the context
        in which these data components are being actively used.

        <br />Present Theory & Practices<br />
        In modern cities parents are went to work and their children is alone at
        home. If something wrong happen around child, technology detects change
        in children expression and send the message or alarm to their parents.
        We can use this methodology in car to avoid accidents. Commercial and
        heavy vehicle travels continuously so, they have to drive in tired
        condition sometime they get sleep during night travelling. So with the
        facial detection we can detect the motion of closing eye of driver and
        ring the alarm. We use this technology to avoid crash of vehicle.

        <br />Need<br />
        Child abuse is an international public health crisis. In India, every
        second child reported facing emotion abuse as well as two out of every
        three children were physically abuse and its ratio is increasing day by
        day. Child abuse can result in immediate adverse physical effects.
        Physical and emotional abuse have comparable effects on a Child
        emotional state and have been linked to childhood depression, low self
        compassion and negative thoughts.

        <br />Aim-<br />
        To detect an abnormal activity that is being carried out with children
        and avoiding the abuse through alerts using feature extraction and ML.
        <br />Objectives-<br />
        <li>
          To introduce a novel approach to detect abnormal behavior with
          children.
        </li>
        <li>To put forward a feature extraction and description method.</li>
        <li>To detect abnormal activity and alert using buzzer.</li>
        <li>To ensure safety of students</li>
